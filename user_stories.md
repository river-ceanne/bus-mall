USER STORIES

- As a developer, I want to build a website that shows pictures to a focus group so that the number of clicks or selection this groups pick will be analyzed for statistical marketing purposes. 

- As a developer, I want to show a set of three pictures to the user to choose side-by-side so that they can compare each one easily for the marketing alaysis.

- As a developer, I want to show random non-duplicating images per 3-picture selection so that the selection is diverse enough / does not feel biased. 

- As a developer, I want to turn off the selection event listener after the user selects upto 25 times and display a voting tally message for the pictures such as '3 votes for the Banana Slicer.'

- As a developer, I want to also show non-duplicating images in 2 consecutive 3-picture selection so that it will not feel redundant to the user for selection. 

- As a user, I want to see a website that is well organized and designed so that it will be nice to view and easy to be engaged with during the visit. 

- As a user, I want to see a set of clear instructions on the website so that it will be easy to follow along/ user-friendly enough. 

- As a user, I want to see good accessibilty features so that I will be able to clearly see what is going on in the page. 

- As a user, I want to see consistency in the image sizes so that none of the images will be more overwhelming than the other.
